- 15% of the element taxed in the fund where a person aged less than preservation age receives a disability superannuation income stream. 
- 15% of the element taxed in the fund where the person is in receipt of a superannuation income stream because of the death of another person of whom the person is a dependant and where the person is under 60 years of age when they receive the benefit and the deceased died before aged 60.
