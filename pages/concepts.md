# Concepts

Tax consists mostly smaller concepts that all sum together to give you your taxable income. The idea of a concept is not defined anywhere in tax legislation but they are things that are recurring throughout all returns. The order here is generally the same as what is found in a return and where a return numbers a concept I have included that reference number here. Most of these won't apply to you, tax usually take a whitelist(?) approach to things that are included in your return (If a definition is relevant then it is included in your tax income)
